Simulate memory mechanism

Program description:
In "Virtual Memory Management" we simulate memory mechanism. We used in the paging mechanism to run programs when only part of them stored in the memory . The virtual memory divided to pages that stored in the main memory  only when they needed.

Program files: 
sim_mem.hh  - contains functions signatures.
sim_mem.cpp - contains the functions realization.
main.cpp - contains main .
makefile - to compile the program.

Compile and running: 
In Visual Studio code
To compile: Ctrl + shift + b 
To run: Ctrl + f5 

In Linnux terminal:
to compile : g++ main.cpp sim_mem.cpp -o main
to run: ./main
